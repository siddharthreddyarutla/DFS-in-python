# DFS-in-python
Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for searching a graph or tree data structure. The algorithm starts at the root (top) node of a tree and goes as far as it can down a given branch (path), then backtracks until it finds an unexplored path, and then explores it.

<H1> ALGORITHM</H1>

1.	Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices on top of a stack.
2.	Take the top item of the stack and add it to the visited list.
3.	Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to the top of the stack.
4.	Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty.
